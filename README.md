### Inspiration
This project is inspired by [vue-bootstrap-boilerplate](https://github.com/guillaumeduhan/vue-bootstrap-boilerplate) and **ofcourse the repeated effort everytime I start a new project** :)

### Starter VueJS Boilerplate
This is a boilerplate for building web applications with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and the following tools:
* Vuejs
* Vuex
* VueRouter
* BootstrapVue
* Axios
* Firebase for Authentication
* SignIn, SignUp, SignOut
* Public and Private Page(s)
* Environment Variables and Config for different deplyment platforms such as - `dev` and `prod`.


This app comes powerd with some basic features and tools to help you get started quickly without much of `assumption baggages`!

## How to run?

**Very Important: To run this a firebase credentials are needed. Please have a free firebase app config ready - this can be easily obtained from [Firebase Console](https://firebase.google.com). The `main` app mounts post firebase initialization. Please check `main.js` before running the server.**
```
git clone <repo>
cd <root_folder>
npm i
npm run serve
```

Enjoy!
